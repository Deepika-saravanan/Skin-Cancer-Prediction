- Easily extendable for more classes and real-world datasets

## 🔍 Algorithms Used

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Deep learning architecture specialized in image classification.
- **Image Data Augmentation**: Improves generalization by creating variations of input data.
- **Softmax Activation**: For multi-class classification.

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure the following libraries are installed:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-disease-prediction.git
cd skin-disease-prediction
Place the dataset in the dataset/ folder.

Open and run skin-diseaese-prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Train the model and evaluate the predictions.
