#🧬 Skin Disease Prediction using Deep Learning
This project presents a Deep Learning-based approach for predicting various types of skin diseases from images. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of skin disease images and utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate classification.

##🧠 About the Project
Skin diseases can often be identified through visual patterns. This project aims to assist dermatologists or users by predicting the disease type from an image using a trained CNN model. The model classifies images into multiple categories of skin diseases with a decent accuracy rate.

##📁 Dataset
The dataset contains images categorized into different classes of skin diseases.

##Preprocessing includes:

Image resizing to 180x180

Normalization

Splitting into training and validation sets (80-20 split)

Note: You can use publicly available skin disease datasets such as HAM10000 or your own dataset.

##🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow & Keras

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

scikit-learn
